<p>Software testing <br />is a process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding
 the software bugs. It can also be stated as the process of validating
 and verifying that a software program or application or product: Meets the business
 and technical requirements that guided it's design and development.</p>
<p>As the number of possible tests <br />for even simple software components is practically infinite, all software testing uses some strategy to select tests that are feasible for the available time and resources. As a result, software testing typically (but not exclusively) attempts to execute a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs (errors or other defects). The job of testing is an iterative process as when one bug is fixed, it can illuminate other, deeper bugs, or can even create new ones.

<hr />
Software testing can provide objective, independent information about the quality of software and risk of its failure to users or        sponsors.</p>
